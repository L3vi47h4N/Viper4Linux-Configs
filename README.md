# Viper4Linux-Configs
Audio configs from various members of our community. 

Please use the following format for submitting new configs:  
`$username-$short_description_with_underscores-audio.conf`  

If your config uses an IRS file, include a comment in your audio.conf linking to that. You can include your IRS file here as well, but please follow the naming convention shown above for it with the extension .irs  

You can find the main project for Viper4Linux over here: https://github.com/Audio4Linux/Viper4Linux  


Looking forward to all your dope configs!
